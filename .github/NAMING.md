# Repository Naming Note

## Image Name: chatwoot_custon

The Docker image name `chatwoot_custon` (with an 'o' instead of 'custom') is **intentional** and matches the repository name:

```
https://github.com/JeronimoKarasek/Chatwoot_custon
```

This is the user's chosen branding for their custom Chatwoot version, not a typo.

## Image Registry Path

```
ghcr.io/jeronimokarasek/chatwoot_custon:latest
```

All references to `chatwoot_custon` throughout the codebase are correct and should **not** be changed to `chatwoot_custom`.
